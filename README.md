# Graph Segmentation DLL for Python
this is a c++ full re-implementation of [***Felzenszwalb, P. F. and D. P. Huttenlocher (2004). "Efficient graph-based image segmentation." IJCV***](http://www.people.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf). , wrapped into a plug&play .pyd/.so(for win/linux) DLL lib for Python. Simply download the suitable version of .pyd/.so file and copy it into \$YOUR PYTHON FOLDER\$/Lib/site-packages folder, then you can "import GraphSeg as GS" to use.
